## How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999â€“2008 in Baltimore City?

PED <- readRDS("summarySCC_PM25.rds")

PED_on_road <- PED[PED$fips=="24510" & PED$type=="ON-ROAD",]

## We then need to sum up all Emission-values for each year.
on_road_year <- aggregate(Emissions ~ year, PED_on_road, sum)
